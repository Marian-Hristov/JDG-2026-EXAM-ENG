# Q1 - Logology (7 points)

**Objective:** Design a script that generates an ASCII art logo for "Nocturna Solutions" algorithmically.

## Context

Nocturna Solutions wants to modernize its image and adopt an original logo. However, due to budget constraints, the marketing team decided that this logo must be generated in ASCII art directly from code rather than created by a graphic designer.

## Instructions

- Write a program (in the language of your choice) that draws the logo in the console (standard output), line by line or character by character, using programming logic.
- The logo must represent the company "Nocturna Solutions" with visual elements evoking themes such as night, sleep, etc.

## Technical constraints

🚫 Forbidden:

- Copy-pasting a full ASCII drawing into a single string variable.
- Writing a long series of `print("  *  ")` without any underlying logic.

✅ What is expected:

- Use **loops** (`for`, `while`) to generate repetitive patterns (e.g., a starry sky, a border).
- Use **conditions** (`if/else`) to decide which character to display at which position (e.g., drawing a circle or a diagonal).
- Use **functions** to reuse parts of the drawing, perform transformations (rotation, symmetry, duplication, etc.), or organize the code.
- The script must be executable and display the result directly in the terminal.

| Criterion              | Points | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | :----: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Algorithmic logic**  |   3    | The logo is constructed by code (loops, position calculations) and is not static. |
| **Creativity & theme** |   3    | The result is visually consistent with "Nocturna Solutions".                      |
| **Code quality**       |   1    | Clean, modular code, well-named variables, no unnecessary repetition.             |
| **Total**              | **7**  |                                                                                   |
