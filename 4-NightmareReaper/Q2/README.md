# Q2 - Steganography (9 points)

**Objective:** Extract **3 flags** from the provided files and give a **clear explanation** of the approach used for each extraction.

## Context

Three files each contain a hidden element. The goal is to identify an appropriate approach to uncover their secret and to document a reproducible method.

## Instructions

- Solve the **3 problems** below.
- For each problem: provide the **steps**, the tool (or script) used, and the parameters if applicable.
- Provide the corresponding **flag**.

### Example

If you found the flag **"FLAG-HAHAHAHAH"** using an online tool:

- Mention the parameters and the tool used.

If you used a custom tool:

- Describe the method in detail.

## Problems

### Problem 1: Alterations

The file **alterations.png** appears slightly different from its counterpart **non-altered-bonus.jpg**.  
Can you find the difference?

### Problem 2: Hidden Content

The file **InYourDreams.jpg** hides something interesting.  
What could it be?

### Problem 3: Suspicious File

The file **whats-this.mrx** looks suspicious.  
What is it?

## Technical constraints

- **Bruteforce is allowed** (it’s your machine).

## Evaluation criteria

| Criterion              | Points | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -----: | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Flag #1 + approach** |      3 | Flag found + coherent, reproducible approach |
| **Flag #2 + approach** |      3 | Flag found + coherent, reproducible approach |
| **Flag #3 + approach** |      3 | Flag found + coherent, reproducible approach |
| **Total**              |  **9** |                                              |

## Hint

If parameters are needed, they are probably the default ones... ;)
