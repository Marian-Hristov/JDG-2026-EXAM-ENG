# Exam – Software Engineering and Computer Science

Welcome to the repo for the practical exam of the **Software Engineering and Computer Science** discipline of the 2026 Engineering Games.

The files for the mandates to be completed are located in this repo. You must download (or clone) this repo locally, complete the exercises in the provided folders, and then submit according to the submission instructions below.

## 📝 Download the code

Download or clone this GitHub repo to your local machine before starting the exam.

\* _Note: If you are submitting via Git, fork the repo before cloning._

```

Otherwise, you can download the repo as a ZIP file by clicking the "Code" button then "Download ZIP" on the repo's GitHub page.

## 📁 Repo Structure

The mandates to be completed are located in this folder. Each mandate contains:

- a `README.md` with the context and general instructions for the mandate.
- `QX` subfolders (one question per subfolder), each with its own `README.md` and the provided input files / templates.

#### Global Structure:

- `2-SomniaData/` (databases / modeling and SQL queries)
- `3-AlgoriaLabs/` (algorithms / problem solving)
- `4-NightmareReaper/` (security / cybersecurity challenges)
- `5-OleoducsScripts/` (DevOps / Docker, scripts and pipelines)
- `6-EveningDream/` (backend / server design and implementation)
- `7-DreamKernel/` (systems / low level and debugging)
- `8-Evident/` (UI/UX / analysis and improvement of a prototype)
- `10-SchleepShop/` (AI / prompt engineering)
- `11-NocturnaSolution/` (questions requiring creativity / varied tools and formats)

Read carefully each `README.md` of the question (`QX`) you are working on: it specifies the expected deliverables, the output format, as well as the provided input files.

## 📄 Submission

You have two options to submit your finalized work:

1. **Via GitHub**: Fork this repo, complete the exercises in your fork, then create a Pull Request before the end of the exam. Ensure that your fork is private and shared only with your team members during the exam, otherwise other teams could have access to your solutions.
2. **Via ZIP + Google Form**: Compress the folder **of one mandate at a time** in `.zip` format and send it via the submission Google Form. Clearly identify your team as well as the mandate number in the file name (e.g., `TeamPoly_Mandate7.zip`) and in the Google Form.

## ⚠️ Important Rules

- **No AI** is allowed during the exam (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, AI search in the browser, etc.). Any use will lead to a **grade of 0 for the entire team**.
- The exam is **open book** — any documentation other than AI is allowed.
- You can use **any IDE or text editor** of your choice. We recommend VS Code for its versatility.
- You can use **any operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux), but the exam has been tested primarily on Windows. If you experience technical difficulties, contact us immediately.
