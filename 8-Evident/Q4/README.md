# Q4 - Modern interface (6 points)

**Objective:** Modernize the interface of the inspection prototype while keeping all existing features.

## Context

The current interface does not match modern standards of ergonomics and readability. Your mission is to modify `index.html` and `styles.css` (in this Q4 folder) to make the application more clean and modern, adapted to the target audience (field technicians), and to improve it using your suggestions from the previous questions.

## Instructions

- Work only in this `Q4/` folder to avoid altering the original version, and modify the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
- You may add extra files and pages if needed (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, etc.).
- You may also modify `script.js` if necessary, but keep all exposed functional logic intact.
- Try to apply your suggestions from the previous questions (Q1 to Q3) in this new interface.
- Do not use any external frameworks (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only).
- Have fun 🥳

## Evaluation criteria

The evaluation will be done by comparing your interface with those of the other teams. The best team will receive 6 points, and the others will be graded proportionally (rounded to the nearest half point).

The quality of your code will also be taken into account (clarity, DRY, maintainability, etc.).
