# Q1-Q3 - UX analysis of the inspection prototype (2 + 2 + 4 points)

**Objective:** Critically evaluate the user experience of the prototype and identify potential obstacles.

## Context

The fictitious prototype presented here is a small web application that allows you to record inspections, view simple metrics, and receive automatic recommendations. The code is intentionally simple (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) and contains several usability issues to analyze.

## Execution

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) or serve the folder via a local server if needed.
- No installation is required.

## Q1 - Cognitive load (2 points)

**Objective:** Analyze the protype's interface and identify two elements that could increase users' cognitive
load. Propose a solution to reduce this load while maintaining functionality.

**Deliverable:** In the exam booklet

## Q2 - Dark patterns (2 points)

**Objective:** Explain what a UI/UX dark pattern is. Identify a dark pattern in the application, Justify why it's
a dark pattern and how you would fix it.

**Deliverable:** In the exam booklet

## Q3 - UX gaps and improvements (4 points)

**Objective:** You must:

- Identify at least 3 gaps or friction points in the tool's user experience.
- For each gap, make a link to Tognazzini's usability principles (below) and how these
  are not followed.
- Then propose a concrete improvement for each gap, justifying how it would solve the
  problem.
