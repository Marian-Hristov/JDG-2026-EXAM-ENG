# Mandate 8 – UI/UX - Evident

**Context:**
Evident is an international company recognized for its non-destructive testing solutions that detect
internal defects such as cracks, porosities, voids, or irregularities in various materials. The company
also develops software solutions specifically designed for technicians and inspectors in the field, who
are generally non-IT specialists. These tools must be extremely easy to use, robust, ergonomic, and
operate reliably in demanding environments (factories, worksites, noisy or dimly lit areas).

In this mandate, you will perform a critical UX evaluation of a fictitious experimental prototype and propose improvements. The prototype included in this folder is intentionally simple and contains usability issues designed to serve as an object of analysis and a modernization exercise.
